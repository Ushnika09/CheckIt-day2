✅ CheckIt –– Tasks in. Chaos out.
Because sticky notes are so last season. 😎

Welcome to CheckIt – your personal task bouncer at the club of productivity.
Built with pure HTML, CSS & JavaScript – no libraries, no frameworks, just me and the DOM vibin’.

🎯 What’s the deal?
🚀 Add your task like a boss

☑️ Check it when you're done adulting

🗑️ Yeet it into the void when it's no longer needed

🎨 All wrapped up in a sweet little UI with soft shadows and gradient goodness

🧪 Tech Stack (a.k.a The Brain Behind the Beauty)
🧱 HTML – basic bones

💅 CSS – all the drip (gradients, flexbox, shadows)

🧠 Vanilla JavaScript – DOM wrangling like a cowboy

🤓 Why I Built It
Because I wanted to:

🎯 Practice DOM manipulation like createElement, appendChild, .value, .checked

💥 Handle events like a pro (click, change, delete)

🧼 Build something clean, interactive, and minimal — zero libraries, full satisfaction

🛠 How to Run This Magic
Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/Ushnika09/CheckIt-day2
Open index.html in your browser

Stare in awe 🤯

✨ Features (a.k.a party tricks)
✔ Add new tasks (as many as your overthinking mind desires)

💀 Delete tasks (when you've slain them like a legend)

✅ Checkboxes that literally cross things off your list

😍 Gradient background so nice you’ll forget you're being productive

🧠 What I Revised
JavaScript DOM is wild but fun 🌪

CSS flex is a layout wizard 🧙‍♂️

Writing .style.cssText feels illegal but it works 😂

Adding onclick, addEventListener, and remove() made me feel like a hacker 💻

🎨 Vibe Check (UI Highlights)
