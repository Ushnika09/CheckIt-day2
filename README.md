✅ CheckIt — Tasks in. Chaos out.
Because sticky notes are so last season. 😎

Welcome to CheckIt – your personal task bouncer at the club of productivity.
Built with pure HTML, CSS & JavaScript – no libraries, no frameworks, just me and the DOM vibin’.

🎯 What’s the Deal?
🚀 Add your task like a boss

☑️ Check it when you're done adulting

🗑️ Yeet it into the void when it's no longer needed

🎨 All wrapped up in a sweet little UI with soft shadows and gradient goodness

🧪 Tech Stack — The Brain Behind the Beauty
Tech	What It Does
🧱 HTML	Basic bones
💅 CSS	All the drip — gradients, flexbox, shadows
🧠 JavaScript	DOM wrangling like a cowboy 🤠

🤓 Why I Built It
I wanted to:

🎯 Practice DOM manipulation: createElement, appendChild, .value, .checked

💥 Handle events like a pro: click, change, delete

🧼 Build something clean, interactive, and minimal

💯 Challenge myself with zero libraries, just vanilla power

🛠 How to Run This Magic

    git clone https://github.com/Ushnika09/CheckIt-day2
    
Open index.html in your browser.
Stare in awe 🤯

✨ Features — a.k.a Party Tricks
✔ Add new tasks (as many as your overthinking mind desires)

✅ Checkboxes that literally cross things off your list

💀 Delete tasks (when you’ve slain them like a legend)

😍 Gradient background so nice you’ll forget you’re being productive

🧠 What I Revised
JavaScript DOM is wild but fun 🌪

CSS flex is a layout wizard 🧙‍♂️

Writing .style.cssText feels illegal but it works 😂

Adding onclick, addEventListener(), and .remove() made me feel like a hacker 💻

🎨 Vibe Check — UI Highlights
“Pastel but powerful.” — Me 💅

background: linear-gradient(125deg, #e0ffe0 0%, #ccf2ff 100%)

Task containers with soft shadows and rounded corners

Cute lil’ checkbox + delete icon combo 🥹
